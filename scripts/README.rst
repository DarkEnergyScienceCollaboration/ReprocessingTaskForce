A bunch of utility scripts for data reprocessing

First things to do to use them at CC-IN2P3::

  cd /sps/lsst/dev/lsstprod/ReprocessingTaskForce
  source rtf_setup.sh

And make sure that the local ReprocessingTaskForce repository is up to date::

  cd /sps/lsst/dev/lsstprod/ReprocessingTaskForce
  git pull
